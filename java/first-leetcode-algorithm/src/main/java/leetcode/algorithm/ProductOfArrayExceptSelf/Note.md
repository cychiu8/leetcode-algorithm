# 238. ProductOfArrayExceptSelf

## constraints

* The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.

    - This condition is typically provided to ensure that the problem can be solved within the constraints of a 32-bit integer.
    - In many programming languages, including Java and C++, a 32-bit integer can hold values from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647. If the product of any prefix or suffix of nums exceeds this range, it could lead to integer overflow or underflow, which would result in incorrect calculations.
    - By guaranteeing that the product of any prefix or suffix of nums fits in a 32-bit integer, the problem setter is ensuring that you don't need to handle such overflow or underflow conditions in your solution. This allows you to focus on the main logic of the problem instead of worrying about the limitations of the data type.
